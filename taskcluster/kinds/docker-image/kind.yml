# make a task for each docker-image we might want.  For the moment, since we
# write artifacts for each, these are whitelisted, but ideally that will change
# (to use subdirectory clones of the proper directory), at which point we can
# generate tasks for every docker image in the directory, secure in the
# knowledge that unnecessary images will be omitted from the target task graph
